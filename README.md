### 11-785 Deep Learning

My Attempt at  the 11-785 Deep Learning Course at CMU.

### Anecdotal Notes

"Intro" to Deep Learning turned out to be more of a "Speed run" through Deep Learning.
I didn't expect to sink so much time into the course or learn as much as I did. But, I'm guessing that is because I am a total noob in the field.
So, some combination of beginner's gain and the time sink was happening for me.
On top of everything, my differential calculus was rusty owing to not having touched math in the last 4 years. I'm simplifying too much when I say I was behind a bit.

Took me a while to understand the importance of the Office hours and the weekly Hackathons that happen.
